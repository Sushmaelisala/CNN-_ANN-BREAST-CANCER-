# CNN-_ANN-BREAST-CANCER-

This notebook implements and compares CNN and ANN models for classifying breast cancer data into malignant or benign categories. The project demonstrates how deep learning can effectively analyze medical datasets, extract features, and make accurate predictions.


ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Detection using CNN & ANN:

ðŸ“˜ Project Title:
Breast Cancer Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

ðŸ“Œ Description:
This notebook implements and compares CNN and ANN models for classifying breast cancer data into malignant or benign categories. The project demonstrates how deep learning can effectively analyze medical datasets, extract features, and make accurate predictions.

Both ANN (feedforward neural network) and CNN (with convolution and pooling layers) are trained and evaluated on the dataset, with metrics such as accuracy and loss used to measure performance.


ðŸ§° Technologies Used:

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

ðŸ“Š Dataset:
- Breast Cancer Dataset (Likely from Scikit-learn or UCI repository)
- Features include cell characteristics (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness, etc.)
- Target: 0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant

ðŸ”§ Features of the Notebook:
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model design using ANN and CNN
- Training and validation with evaluation metrics
- Visualization of training accuracy and loss
- Accuracy comparison between models


ðŸ“ˆ Output:
- Model summary for CNN and ANN
- Accuracy and loss values
- Confusion matrix (optional)
- Final accuracy comparison for breast cancer prediction
